## üîß Configuration

### AWS Integration
1. **Set Up AWS S3**  
   - Create an S3 bucket for storing user-uploaded photos.
   - Update the bucket name in the app's configuration files.

2. **Configure Lambda**  
   - Deploy an AWS Lambda function for species recognition.
   - Connect Lambda to AWS Rekognition for processing uploaded photos.

3. **Amplify Push**  
   - After configuring S3, Lambda, and other resources, push the changes to AWS:  
     ```bash
     amplify push
     ```

## üìä Data Flow

1. **User uploads a photo.**  
2. The photo is sent to AWS S3.  
3. An AWS Lambda function triggers species recognition using AWS Rekognition.  
4. Recognized data is returned to the app and stored in the database.  
5. The sighting is displayed on the interactive map with metadata.
